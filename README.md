# pg_twkb

For now I put it here just for my own versioning.

But here is some cool functionality that I hope to document so it gets usable in the future.

Here is functionality for creating indexed twkb-files.
That is files with a structure so a client quite fast can find the geoemtries needed for drawing also from quite large files.
